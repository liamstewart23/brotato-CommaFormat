<img width="372" height="97" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-06 215214" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adb80108-7a8e-4cea-b7b0-79807d07cc7e" />

This lightweight quality-of-life mod improves the readability of gold amounts in [Brotato](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/) by adding comma separators to the in-game currency display. No more squinting at long numbersâ€”now it's easy to tell how much gold you've racked up at a glance!

## ðŸ’° Why use this mod?
When numbers get big, like in the late game, it becomes harder to read them quickly. This mod adds thousands separators (commas) to your gold amount so you can focus on surviving, not counting zeros.

## ðŸ”¢ Examples:
Example of formatting numbers with commas 1234567 â†’ 1,234,567

| Original Number | After Formatting  |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| 0               | 0                 |
| 12              | 12                |
| 123             | 123               |
| 1234            | 1,234             |
| 12345           | 12,345            |
| 123456          | 123,456           |
| 1234567         | 1,234,567         |
| 12345678        | 12,345,678        |
